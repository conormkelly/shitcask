# Test data

This is a segment file build from the [complete works of Shakespearse from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/100-0.txt).

- The `keys` were generated by splitting it every 10 characters.
- The `values` are randomly-generated UUID's (v4), to have something unique to assert against in the tests, since keys can be duplicated.
